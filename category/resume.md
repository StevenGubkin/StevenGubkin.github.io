# Steven Gubkin  

## Executive Summary

* Mathematics PhD
* 7 years experience teaching at the college level.
* New to data science and machine learning (May 2023), but making rapid progress.

## Education & Qualifications

* PhD Mathematics, Ohio State University, 2015
    * [L<sup>2</sup> Mergelyan Theorems in Several Complex Variables](https://etd.ohiolink.edu/apexprod/rws_etd/send_file/send?accession=osu1430998320&disposition=inline)
    * This thesis was in the broad area of "holomorphic approximation theory".  I am finding that this work is preparing me well to think deeply about machine learning, which also deals with approximations in function spaces.
* BSc Mathematics, Case Western Reserve University, 2015
* [Erd≈ës institute data science bootcamp](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/certificates/spring-2023/data-science-boot-camp/steven-gubkin), May 2023
    * Learned how to use numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn libraries.  Learned fundamentals of data science including data collection, exploration, and cleaning, regression and classification techniques, dimension reduction, clustering, and the basics of neural networks.
    * Completed a project to translate American Sign Language to text.
* The website you are currently browsing contains:
    * An exposition of the creation of a MathOverflow tag recommendation system.
    * A few notes on the mathematical underpinnings of machine learning.

## Working Experience

#### Cleveland State University (Associate College Lecturer, 2016/08 - 2023/05) 

* Taught a wide variety of courses including Calculus, Linear Algebra, Multivariate Calculus, Complex Analysis, Abstract Algebra, Discrete Mathematics, and Number Theory.
* Served on committees including Undergraduate Program Committee (helping to design and maintain our major/minor requirements, proposing new courses, etc) and several hiring committees.
* Served as course coordinator for our Mathematics for Future Elementary Educators courses.
    * I was committee chair and primary author of the [Ohio36](https://transfercredit.ohio.gov/educational-partners/educational-partner-initiatives/ohio-transfer-36/learning-outcomes) learning outcomes for these courses (TMM021 and TMM022), which are now the standards used to permit transferability of these courses in the state of Ohio.
* Authored an [intro proof textbook](https://github.com/StevenGubkin/intro-proof) which takes a natural deduction approach.


#### Ohio State University (MOOC Developer, 2012/06 - 2016/06)

* As a graduate student I assisted with the creation of one interactive online textbook and two MOOCs which were run by Ohio State through Coursera.
    * This [open source online interactive Calculus textbook](https://ximera.osu.edu/mooculus/calculus1) is still in use by Ohio State.
    * [Mooculus](https://github.com/ASCTech/mooculus/tree/master/public/khan-exercises/) was a fairly standard Calc 1 experience.  I wrote almost all of the interactive exercises for this course using Khan Academy's exercise framework.
    * [M2O2C2](https://github.com/kisonecat/m2o2c2) was an interactive tensor algebra based multivariable calculus course.  I authored most of the "textbook" content for this course.  You can read my description of the course content [here](https://matheducators.stackexchange.com/a/139/117) if you are interested.
